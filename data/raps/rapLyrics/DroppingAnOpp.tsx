const lyrics = `I pull out the glock
Two .45’s in your head make you stop

Everything in stock, serving coke to the boys in the block
I catch a body and make that opp drop
I bought a shotty from the local shop

Huh?
Dropping an opp with a glock from the shop?
Catching a body with a shotty no karate?

I pull up in a ghost
We go so fast that the time seem slow
I’ll drive west to east for some snow
I’m super saiyan so my skin glows
I get all of the dough
Load up the truck but the stuff overflow
I dribble the ball and I call an iso
Opps tryna guard me I hit a field goal

Get the money and I dip
Shoot em in the face and reload the clip
You can tell that I’m rich
Just by the way my that my neck always drips
I got all types of kicks
And I pull up with all types of sticks
I bought a brand new whip
You can see that it goes really quick

Getting the money and dip
Pull out the glock from my hip
You can tell that I’m rich
I put down all of the white and black chips
I got sauce on my wrist
I got AR’s equipped
I got glocks with the switch

Everything in stock, serving coke to the boys in the block
I catch a body and make that opp drop
I bought a shotty from the local shop

Huh?
Dropping an opp with a glock from the shop?
Catching a body with a shotty no karate?
Lemme switch up the flow
I ball hard and I ball like a pro
I see green light and I go
And I defeat all my foes

And I hit you with right jab blow
If you don’t pay what you owe
My ice priceless like Van Gogh
You could say I’m buried in snow

I just came back from the bank with 10k in my pockets,
And I buy the hood rockets
3080 overclocking
Pull up and we glockin
All you sheep flocking
Lamb chops are restocking

I got 10k in my pockets, 
I buy the hood some rockets
I bought a 3080 ti and I overclocked it
Ford truck shot and I blocked it
No point in tryna be modest
I get all of the profits

Everything in stock, serving coke to the boys in the block
I catch a body and make that opp drop
I bought a shotty from the local shop

Huh?
Dropping an opp with a glock from the shop?
Catching a body with a shotty no karate?
