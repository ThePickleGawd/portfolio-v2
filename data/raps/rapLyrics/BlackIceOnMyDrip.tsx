const lyrics = `Look, you can have a seat,
Listen while you feel the heat.
Why you livin’ in the streets
I don’t hafta check receipts

What are you saying? I’m not super saiyan?
I pull the glock and we do some spraying
Listen up boy, we are not playin’
I bring my knife and I do the slayin’

I got...
Black ice on my drip
40k around my wrist
Pull up in a brand new whip,
.223’s my aim don’t miss (gun fire)

And I’m not sure what I’m saying,
But I know I’m a super saiyan
I’m the Godly Poker Gawd…
You guys all are frauds
Mess around you’ll get shot
Uh huh thats what I thought

I might pull up to your city (skrrt),
You know I keep a pair of glizzys (chk chk).
Laying around, dead in the streets,
You think that you’ll live in peace (pieces)
I got new guns, a hundred on me,
Might turn them on, and drown your whole fleet

I got...
Black ice on my drip,
40k around my wrist
Pull up in a brand new whip,
.223’s my aim don’t miss (gun fire)

I want my money right now,
Otherwise you’ll get pow powed
Leader of the creed, so please bow
Money come dirty? I’ll allow it,
Only mili? Ok wow

Feel kinda rich, so I’ll buy me a bay,
I’m thinking SF or the Monterey

Cuz I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 m’s in my bank account,
Haha, 21 but with bigger guns

Got Ice on my wrist, I think you get the gist.
Rollies and Rari’s, I be driving real quick.
I got big guns, you be playing with sticks

Got a lotta money and my racks come thick.
Been staying at home so don’t you come sick
Please get your vaccines its just a little prick
I have the best aim and a big (cough)

Got a big (cough cough)

I got...
Black ice on my drip,
40k around my wrist
Pull up in a brand new whip,
.223’s my aim don’t miss (gun fire)

Wow, how does it feel?
I might sign a record deal.
Your on the streets eating happy meals
I eat steak and slow roast veal
Bring the cash we’ll make a deal,
You know that my stuff is real
So much money it's surreal,
Block that shot I get the steal

I walk down the street, I’m surrounded by fools
I got straight A’s and I do well in school
I think that that’s pretty cool,
Might buy a backyard pool
Lightsaber duel, go find a new jewel
I got the stuff, while you smokin’ juels

I got...
Black ice on my drip,
40k around my wrist
Pull up in a brand new whip,
.223’s my aim don’t miss
