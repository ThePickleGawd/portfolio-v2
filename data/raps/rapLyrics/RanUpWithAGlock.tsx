const lyrics = `Don’t even know what I’m sayin’,
But I’m a super saiyan

Ran up to your block with a glock,
You can see the gun is cocked (chk chk)
I might shoot you I the cock and you can’t really stop it
Pow Pow, your body gon drop (pow pow)

And you know I brought my knife (ching)
You will be begging by your life (bro)
Never been in black and white stripes (no)
I’ve been playing real nice (woah)

It’s gonna make you bleed
Med kit is all you need
Lets have something agreed, I’m the
Leader of the creed and you should bow on your knees
You know I’m gonna succeed
That's the Dylan guarantee
All your homies have flee’d, cuz they’re
Scared of my glock and .223’s, ghost pulling up with high speed, I’m the type to do good deeds
I don’t ask with please
You don’t wanna mess with me
I’m a whole different breed
Expectations are what I exceed
Ok let's proceed…

Gotta new flow and its smooth like butter
How could you hate me I came from under
How do I do it? It’s truly a wonder
Bullets flying in the air sounds like thunder
Back in my crib, they call me the hunter

Might step back and take a three
You know, that you’ll never leave
Back to words that end with E
I have a whole library
You know that you can’t compete
Cool kid hacker, I speak 1337
Buddy, you are not street
You can go and have a seat
You have felt the true defeat
rm -f (dash F) please delete

Wow, wow, wow…

How does it feel to have lost
Welcome mat out played by Frost
Ranked match and you tossed (threw)
Left right, you’ve been sauced (ooh)
No mask and you coughed (ew)
Ask me how much my shirt cost (a milli)
Young CEO I’m the boss (yeah)
Your girl named Rachel I’m Ross (yeah)

(Hayden… Hahaha)

Ran up to your block with a glock,
You can see the gun is cocked (chk chk)
I might shoot you I the cock and you can’t really stop it
Pow Pow, your body gon drop (pow pow)

Ran up to your block with a glock,
Money come steady don’t stop (no)
Nvidia tripled their stock (ching)
Rtx all out of stock (aww)

Ran up to your block with a glock,
Got caught selling coke blocks (sniff),
Big guns, I am a jock (grunt),
Big guns, I snipe like a hawk (pow)

Ran up to your block with a glock,
Your door closed but unlocked
Devil at your door knock knock
You will need a stim from Doc

Ran up to your block with a glock,
You think you’re cool but you’re not
Me and you, should have a talk
I shepherd you with your flock

Ran up to your block with a glock,
I am a leader like Spock
Don’t mess with me you gon’ get shot
Don’t try to be something your not

Ran up to your block with a glock,
This time I promise I’ll stop
Time to switch the flow
I think you already know
Aw, I guess it's over
