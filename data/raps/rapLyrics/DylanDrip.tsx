const lyrics = `I got back from the bank with the money,
you think that it's funny, you might end up bloody

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I got back from the bank with the money,
you think that it's funny, you might end up bloody
These kids cannot touch me
I run for a toudie
These kids cannot stop me
They hurting their tummies

I got diamonds on my wrist,
All of this ice make me cold make me sick
I got expensive dior drip
Mess around and I bust off a clip
Get the whip, on my hip
I got the guns with the vertical grip
Pray to god that you ain’t getting hit
Got the glock and my finger might slip
New drip call it Dylan Drip
New kicks might pull a backflip
Strapped up we got AR’s equipped
Glass up made it out the crib
All this cash make my pockets look big

What was I saying, I cannot explain it
I go Super Saiyan, and I know I can sustain it
All of you haters are mentally crazy
I drive a mercedes, I send him to Hades
I’m balling out cuz I’m basically Brady
I’m balling out cuz they cannot get me

Nah they cannot get me
I ball like Tom Brady
I make all the money come daily
Your cash flows a maybe
I get all the dough so it's clear that they pay me
You’re girl acting shady
Just wait 9 more months and she might have a baby
And please do not blame me, it was probably Cheney… 


Oh no, I turned on the autotune!

I got back from the bank with the money,
you think that it's funny, you might end up bloody
These kids cannot touch me
I run for a toudie
These kids cannot stop me
They hurting their tummies

I got diamonds on my wrist,
All of this ice make me cold make me sick
I got expensive dior drip
Mess around and I bust off a clip

Hey, my drip looking great
I don’t need your hate
You know I ball hard cuz I go get the ace
Shoot you in the face
These kids look at me and they don’t know what to say
Like boy do not play
I make him obey

Pull up to your block with a 12 inch glock in my sock,
Shoot at the opps, make em call the cops
Make em pray to god that he doesn’t lose his cock
Never gonna stop, try to make me stop
Try and mess around and your body gon’ pop
Pray for the guy cleaning the mess with a mop
Pull up with the gang
Make em say my name
Light it on flames

Pull up to your block, with a 12 glock in my sock
Shoot him and the opps, he scared so he called up the cops
We cut off his cock, look at him trying to walk
Never gonna stop, he tried to make me stop

We cut off his cock, look at him trying to walk
Shoot him and the opps, he scared so he called up the cops

Yo, lemme switch up the flow
I ball hard like a pro
See green light and I go, what's the route oh its a go
Where did the defense go
I guess they all just slow
I collect all the dough
I just went to sub zero

Go to the store
Spend all the dough
Ice on my wrist so my blood turn to snow
Where did he go
Nobody knows
We took him back all the way to the O
You car is slow
My wrist is froze
24 karats on my chain thats pure gold
Fumbled the bag
Fumbled the throw
Oh my god, this kid he sold
