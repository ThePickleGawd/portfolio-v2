const lyrics = `I give rollies to the homies
They don’t even gotta owe me
I got cash flowing for me
And I shoot like I’m kobe
Got that glock right beside me
Load the clip with .223’s
Boutta shoot down the city
Pow pow feel the glizzy

I’m so rich I’m like a money tree,
You are not ahead of me
I speak with clarity, I am the nominee

Got a lotta money, and I think it's kinda funny
How your always broke, and how you always choke
And you said, do you like me nope, ooh I think that you choked
And, you lost your hope, and now you smoking dope,
How do you even cope, I would never even know
I put on the scope, AR 50 running close

I’m big time philanthropist
Boy you should stop, 
Or we gon’ throw some fists, and you’ll take all the hits,
You know I never miss
You can drown in piss
I am so done with this,
I drink boba bliss

And you just a little boy,
You play with little toys
I am the real McCoy,
I live life with joy
Your house I might destroy
Big bombs I might deploy
You live in Illinois
Prepare to hear some noise

I give rollies to the homies
They don’t even gotta owe me
I got cash flowing for me
And I shoot like I’m kobe
Got that glock right beside me
Load the clip with .223’s
Boutta shoot down the city
Pow pow feel the glizzy

Rollies for you and Rollies for you,
Wait who are you? I don’t know you get outta my face,
Or I’ll whack you with the mace, I always get my ace
Ghost pulling up in races, high speed in cop chases.
Got a lotta money in my suitcases, lets just face it,
I am the GOAT, you already know it
Might as well start a bakery with all of this dough
I think you broke, can’t match my flow

I give rollies to the homies
They don’t even gotta owe me
I got cash flowing for me
And I shoot like I’m kobe
Got that glock right beside me
Load the clip with .223’s
Boutta shoot down the city
Pow pow feel the glizzy

I got homies on the west side, that's the best side,
AK’s when we go on rides, I’m the tour guide,
You sent your application but you stompin’ in frustration
Sitting in contemplation, you should get on medication
Guess it was denied, you are not qualified
Big tears you might of cried,
Well at least you really tried
This time I’m on your side
Lotta money I’ll provide
Racks growing out wide
Hope you feel better inside

I give rollies to the homies
They don’t even gotta owe me
I got cash flowing for me
And I shoot like I’m kobe
Got that glock right beside me
Load the clip with .223’s
Boutta shoot down the city
Pow pow feel the glizzy

I’m so rich I’m like a money tree,
You are not ahead of me
I speak with clarity, I am the nominee

Got a lotta money, and I think it's kinda funny
How your always broke, and how you always choke
And you said, do you like me nope, ooh I think that you choked
And, you lost your hope, and now you smoking dope,
How do you even cope, I would never even know
I put on the scope, AR 50 running close
