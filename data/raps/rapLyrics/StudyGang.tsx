All of the homies on study game,
Like how could you not fail in school if you aren’t studying?
But how could you rank up to plat (for real)
If your aim is so trash (that’s fax)
That’s the point of the game 
Study hard and improve your aim

Look, violence in the streets gotta stop
Quizlet gang shooting in the streets nonstop (uh huh)
Keeping the peace with my glock
Gotta let the opps know that we on the top (uh)

Handing out A’s to the people
Money so good that there might be a sequel (for real)
Drum gun on me it's a lethal
Study Gang erasing all of the evil (yuh)

Write these facts in a set
Play the study game so I don’t forget (uh huh) 
Bet with me and you’re in debt
I’m like Tom Brady and your like the Jets (trash)

Shoot a three and it's wet?
You can hear the sound of the swish on the net (splash)
Don’t live your life with regret
Play my game or I will get upset

Yeah it's lil lu, I’ve been wit da crew
I stay with the gang, the gang keep me true
The money come dirty, the money come blue
I just made a milli, I spent it on shoes
Checking my grades I got A’s
Carrying my team up to states, I’m lifting weights

And you know I got like 3 plates on em (yuh)
When I flex the earth shakes on em (yuh)
Flexing hard like gucci and denim
I’ve been spitting bars, like I’m spitting some venom (ok)
Study Gang got me on track
I be a track star
Study Gang teaching me facts
I be a math star

So uh, you should really play my game…
Its really cool and I spent a lot of time on it
Its at study.dylanlu.com
And it's free, and yeah

All of the homies on study game,
Like how could you not fail in school if you aren’t studying?
But how could you rank up to plat (for real)
If you’re aim is so trash (that’s fax)
That’s the point of the game 
Study hard and improve your aim

I’ve been playing the game with the gang
Fixing my aim, man I’m insane

I just shot an opp with the op from very long range

If you wanna succeed, study game help your needs
Study game make it really easy
Study gang achieve they dreams
Just wait and see
That’s guaranteed

What? If you’re on quizlet please get off (huh)
Study Gang just making sure they are on top (what?)
If you’re on kahoot please just stop (huh)
Kahoot don’t try to be what your not

If they see you playing, Kahoot
My hitters gon find you, and shoot
Pull up in a mercedes
Shoot like they KD, and I ain’t talking bout no balls in a hoop
Damn like how could you like Kahoot
Damn like how could you be such a fool
No you ain’t cool, do good in school!

Okay wait just listen, (huh?)
You want good grades like Dylan (yeah!)
All you gotta do is open your Mac and study gang teach you facts (uh huh)
Oops just made a hundred racks (cash)
Oops now my pockets too fat (facts)
Oops now my cash be coming in fast like a fast car speeding to the max (what?)

So guys, the moral of the story is to play study game,
I’m not sure what to name it yet but it’ll probably have a better name soon

Also, smash subscribe, or I will smash you`;
