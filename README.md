# Portfolio V2

A portfolio website that I started in 2022. A lot of the information is out of date, but I may slowly update somethings depending on what I need it for.

## Development

```
# Develop locally
npm run dev
```

I'm hosting on Vercel so it will automatically update when I push to GitHub.

## Game

The game is developed in Unity (called "Portfolio Game"). To deploy, run a WebGl build and copy the content into the `/public/gameBuild` folder.
